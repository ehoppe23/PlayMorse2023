The Community Vision Assistive Technology (AT) Lab is an education and resource center in Portland, Oregon that promotes accessibility & inclusion in our community. We collaborate with people with disabilities, families, caregivers, professionals, and community partners. We want more people to see, access, and feel comfortable with AT. The Lab offers AT Consultations, Trainings & Workshops, Social Groups, a free Loan Closet, Equipment, Scholarships and more. 

Many children with physical disabilities, especially those who use adaptive switches, have difficulty accessing the alphabet and therefore, are not often taught the skills they need to read and write. Morse code offers a quicker way to access the alphabet with the use of only 2 switches. A simple 'dot' and 'dash' can open the world of letters and literacy. This website offers games to learn Morse code.
